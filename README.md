# Solidity: Furina Token

Solidity Code that I made, with the name Furina Token we can make this show to the go!

## Description

**Embrace the Flow of Fortune with FurinaToken!**

This Solidity Project, inspired by Fontaine's Hydro Archon, Furina, allows you to create and manage your own token, called Furina Token! Furina Token empowers you to build a vibrant in-game economy and a loyal community reward system, all made by using Furina's Heart and Mind.

## Getting Started

### Installing or Online Compiler

* Download the Contract: Clone or download this repository to your local development environment.
  
* Solidity Compiler: Ensure you have a compatible Solidity compiler installed (version >= 0.8.0 recommended). Popular choices include command-line tools like solc or IDE plugins.

* Online Compiler on the other hand, go to https://remix.ethereum.org/ for compiling

### Executing program

How to run the program:

1. Navigate to Remix: Open your web browser and go to https://remix.ethereum.org/.

2. Create a New File:

* If you haven't already, create a new file named FurinToken.sol (or open your existing file containing the FurinaToken contract code).
* Paste your FurinaToken contract code into the file.
  
3. Compile the Contract:

* Click the "Compile" button in the left-hand sidebar.
* Ensure there are no compilation errors displayed in the bottom panel.

4. Deploy the Contract:

* Click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" button in the left-hand sidebar.

5. Select the Contract:

* In the "Deploy" section of the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel, make sure the contract selected is "FurinToken".

6. Deploy the Contract:

* Click the "Deploy" button.
* If you connected a wallet, a confirmation window will appear in your wallet. Approve the transaction to deploy the contract.
Remix will display the transaction details and the deployed contract address once the deployment is successful.

7. Interact with the Contract (Optional):
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract's functions (e.g., mint, burn) using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel.


## Help

Common Problems

* Double-check your Solidity compiler version and syntax for any errors.
* If using a deployment tool, verify its configuration and connection to the blockchain network.
* Deployment: Funded account, syntax errors, tool configuration.
* Interaction: Function arguments, insufficient balance, network congestion.
